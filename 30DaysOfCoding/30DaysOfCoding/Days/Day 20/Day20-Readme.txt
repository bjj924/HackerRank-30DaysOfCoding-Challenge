Objective

○ Today, we're discussing a simple sorting algorithm called Bubble Sort.
	Consider the following version of Bubble Sort:
	
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	    // Track number of elements swapped during a single array traversal
	    int numberOfSwaps = 0;
	    
	    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
	        // Swap adjacent elements if they are in decreasing order
	        if (a[j] > a[j + 1]) {
	            swap(a[j], a[j + 1]);
	            numberOfSwaps++;
	        }
	    }
	    
	    // If no elements were swapped during a traversal, array is sorted
	    if (numberOfSwaps == 0) {
	        break;
	    }
	}

Task

○ Given an array, a, of size n distinct elements, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following 3 lines:

	Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.
	where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
	
	First Element: firstElement
	where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
	
	Last Element: lastElement
	where lastElement  is the last element in the sorted array.

Hint: To complete this challenge, you will need to add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.

Input Format

○ The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of elements in array a.
○ The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective values of a*0, a*1,...a*n .

Constraints

○ 2 < = n < = 600 
○ 1 < = ai < =  2 x 10*6 , where 0 < = i <n .

Output Format

Print the following three lines of output:

 Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.
 where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
 
 First Element: firstElement
 where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
 
 Last Element: lastElement
 where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.

Sample Input 0
 
3
1 2 3

Sample Output 0

Array is sorted in 0 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 3

Explanation 0

The array is already sorted, so  swaps take place and we print the necessary  lines of output shown above.

Sample Input 1

3
3 2 1

Sample Output 1

Array is sorted in 3 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 3
